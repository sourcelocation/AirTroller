## FAQ

### What's the difference between TrollDrop and AirTroller?
TrollDrop is also an AirDrop spammer, but broke on iOS 12-13, when Apple started introducing "auto-decline" techniques. AirTroller utilises a different method: sending a request and then canceling it right as target receives it, tested on iOS 14-15.7.1 target devices.

### Wasn't it meant to be a $4.99 tweak?
Yes, I planned AirTroller to be a paid tweak / app. I spent so much time on this project, so much effort, that it was awfuly painful to just give away my hard work for free. Why have I decided so? Well, iOS 16 significantly improved AirDrop "auto decline", which AirTroller was abusing - a big deal for a tweak centered around trolling your friends. It does work on iOS 15 though. I honestly don't know what to do with this tweak, because on one side it's a fun project I was working on for around a month I wanted to sell and finally replace my fried GPU, but on the other, it gets more and more useless every day, destroying it's whole purpose. I highly appreciate if you decide to donate :)


### What devices does AirTroller support?
Troller: iOS 14 and above, TrollStore and Jailbreak
Victim: See above, it's important
